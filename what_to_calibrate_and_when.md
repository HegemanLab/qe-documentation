# What to calibrate and When?

Before starting the calibration procedure, please make sure to have a satisfactory sensitivity and good spray stability. In order to achieve these results, the optimal probe position, spray voltage, gas flow rates, capillary temperature and S-Lens voltage have to be determined. As a rule, the Injection Time (IT) times should be less than 5ms, basepeak intensity should be around 1e8 for caffeine, and TIC variation should be <10%. (See Calibration SOP for details) 

**Electronics**: NEVER calibrate.

**Basics (positive or negative)**: Ion Transfer: calibration performed in the factory. Can also performed periodically, e.g. after bakeout.

**Quad Basic**: evaluate only when Isolation Mass and Res. Fails, if it fails please calibrate

* Use quad tune file

**eFT**: evaluate once a month, if it fails please calibrate 

**Analyzer accuracy**: evaluate once a month, if it fails please calibrate

**Isolation Mass and Res. (positive and negative)**:
  * Q Mass/Resolution Calibration (wide iso): evaluate on a monthly basis; should be calibrated if evaluation fails.
  * Q Mass/Resolution Calibration (narrow): evaluate on a monthly basis; should be calibrated if evaluation fails.

* use quad tune file

**MS Mass Calibration (Positive and Negative)**: by default the system will remind you to calibrate every 8 days. Do this again if any of the previous items is calibrated. 

* quad file has CID
