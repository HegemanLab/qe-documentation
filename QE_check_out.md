# Q Exactive Check Out Procedure

1. Store your column in D=acetonitrile with no FA and after you take your column off put it away in cabinet.

2. Take your vials out of auto sampler. Either store in fridge below table or take them with you.

3. Check your shared blanks raw files that should be saved in `D: Data >sharedblanks >month year`. If the intensity and top 5 ions are not the same in the blank before and after your run you will need to clean.  Please refer to cleaning SOP. Depending on the extent of carry over you may need to determine if the LC or MS is dirty or both, also it could be your column. 

4. Fill out user log with details of your samples, solvents, and please make detailed comments either in log or green book. 

5. Move data files to the server `Z:` (shortcut on desktop) then delete from the d: drive. There is not enough room to store your data on the QE computer. 

6. Replace solvents you have used and if you use an entire bottle when refilling please make solvent. Refer to Solvent SOP.

7. Check the sweep cone, does it look dirtier than before you started? If significantly dirty and hasnâ€™t been cleaned for 2-3 weeks please clean it. Refer to SOP.
