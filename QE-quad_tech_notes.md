# QE Quad Tech Notes

QE Users: Please undertand the following information before using tSIM, tMS2 mthod, or anytime you use a narrow m/s window with the quadrupoles.

THe quadrupoles mass filter is the first differentiator in the QE. It works like any other quadrupole, howver, we do not scan the quadrupole. We use the quadrupole at a fixed RF and DC voltage and adjust the offset voltage to vary the quadruople isolation width. We use it as a **Mass Filter** so why is this important? Please see below and ask Dana if you have questions.
