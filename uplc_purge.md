# UPLC Purge

1. Switch the solvents to your appropriate solvents

2. Take control of the Chromeleon Plus Software (if not already) and make sure the appropriate solvent lines (A, B, C or D) are selected in the Eleuent Box and change the lines you arenâ€™t using to 0%  

3. Loosen the purge value (this only takes about a turn and a half, just loosen it until you feel slight tension, DO NOT LOOSEN ALL THE WAY)

4. Under Commands Click the gray box next to Purge: Off
