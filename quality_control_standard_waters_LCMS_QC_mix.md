# Quality control standard Waters LCMS QC Mix

> LCMS QC Reference Standard, Part number 186006963

This product allows the user to evaluate instrument performance (chromatography and accurate mass) before/during analysis of critical material. The LC/MS QCRM is a 9-component mix used to provide a comprehensive reference standard for use with LC/MS instrumentation under a wide variety of conditions and methods. The compounds in this mix give a mixture of responses in ESI (+/-) and APCI (+), however it is optimized for ESI (+). You are not aiming for an exact replicate of the LC/MS chromatogram but the order of components can be referred to. The advantage of this standard is that it can be used with any column under different LC conditions. Therefore, based on the information shown below, the user can customize this standard to their specific method.

    1. Please use this QC sparingly. For example, a 7 day non-targeted metabolomics run should inject 1 ul of QC ~ every 12 hours.
    2. You should monitor a few of the masses for retention time consistency and accurate mass. Compare the first QC file with all others following and if there is a significant RT or mass drift stop your run. 
    3. See below methods. 
    4. Table includes components and mass spectrum is an example.

 **Figure 1.** HSS T3, 2.1 X 100mm, 1.8 column. Solvent A water + 0.1% FA & solvent B acetonitrile. Flow rate 0.5 ml/min, 5 minute linear gradient. TOF MS ES+ Spectrum of the LCMS QCRM Standard using CAN Mobile Phase with a SYNAPTÂ® G2-S MS operated in positive ion mode in high resolution mode. You can use this as a reference of the order in which the components will come out on RP column.
