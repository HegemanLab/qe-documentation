# QE maintenance notes (10/03/16 DMF)

## Check biweekly:
1. Optima water
    a. case under QE, save empty boxes for waste but move and label empty)-  write on board to be ordered when one left

2. Formic Acid in mini fridge. Make sure there is always at least one full 10 pack

3. Waste from LC: under table in bucket empty

4.  Nitrogen flow behind LC should be ~ 80-100

## Monthly:

1. Check Calmix stocks (order more when low) in freezer and make aliquots

2. Ballast the roughing pump: Line raised part with hole, will hiss. Go for 10-15min. To close can turn right or left ~90deg

3. Check oil level. Color (fresh is clear), make sure no particles

4. LC solvents change is on calendar once/mo. New bottles for all lines < 50% organic

5. Water in RA1 for shared blank, change when change solvents

6. Monthly calibrations for all (NOT electronics). If being really stubborn can be sign that ion optics are dirty. Sometimes jumping ahead can help get through a failing test, but MUST be able to go through whole list IN ORDER.

7. NanoLC monthly solvent change followed by calibrations and tests

8. Make sure D drive isn't getting too full

9. Check that users are filling out log and put all maintenance etc in log.

## Other notes: 

1. Preventative maintenance (PM) done yearly by service

2. Clean Slens every 3 months depending on use

3. LC lines cleaning every other month depending on use

4. LC parts in corner by hood 
    a. If need to order UPLC parts in manual
    b. Contact Shelly Jo to order. Jayanti knows how

5. Master calibration files deep within Excalibur. Can be corrupted. Dana has good copy in another file. Can move to calibration file folder to potentially fix. If you do you need to start from the top.
