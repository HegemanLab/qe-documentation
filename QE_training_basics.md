# QE training
> refresher from QE Users Meeting – April 27,2015
 
## General Rules of Thumb

QE is a community instrument, the parts and issues with the instruments are responsibility of ALL users. There is a log as a form of communication to know what the latest update of change made by users. It is the best to have issues documented in the log and Excel file for “QE User log.”
 
As you encounter problems with the instrument, try to read manuals and do as much as possible on your own before getting help from someone more experienced. If you are not sure, feel free to ask for help and/or others’ opinions on how to better solve the problem. At times, the easiest fix is rebooting the computer. If parts are broken or need replacement, e-mail Dana with part number, which can be found in the manual. Note: QE Manual and API source Manual are available online in .pdf files. A copy of each is available in the room, and should not be removed from the room.
 
Calibration is done monthly with fresh calibration mix (stock not aliquots). Tuning is different from calibration; it could or could not affect your result depending on the compounds of interest. Both calibration and tuning procedures are available in SOP. There is also low-mass calibration procedure available. Be conservative with calibration mix.
 
Always treat QE room as a communal space, CLEAN UP after yourself.
 
## Checklists on the Instruments’ Usage

* Check N2, should be 80-120 psi
* Check ALL solvents on UHPLC
* Purge
* Attach column accordingly
* Put samples in the auto sampler
* Column equilibration, check for leaks
* Check wash (seal and needle, separate bottles, make sure the appropriate wash is attached to needle) 
* Check sweep core for cleanliness and probe height
* Read “QE user log”  for issues
* Start sequence
* Wait for first injection
* Look for LC and QE to say running 
 
## Breakdown of Instrument Checklist and Info

### Solvent and degasser

Always check ALL solvents level, make sure to check composition before topping off.

Never let the solvents run dry, you could calculate how much solvent you need per injection volume. Come back as needed to top off solvents while running.

Aqueous solvents are bacteria medium, change to a new bottle of solvent once a month.

Users are welcomed to mix their own solvents. If you change solvents, remember to purge. You may purge everyday to remove air.

Solvents: Optima Water, CHROMOSOLV Plus Acetonitrile, MeOH, formic acid (in fridge) are available in the QE room or hegeman lab solvent cabinet.

Wash solvent composition by default is 10% MeOH for RP or 90% acetonitrile for NP.
 
### Sample

When done, do not leave samples vials in auto sampler.

Follow check out procedure, either save the vials for reuse (deposit in a designated container in the room next to QE) or throw away the vials (deposit into a glass waste container).

If you are going to save the sample in the vials; once punctured, the solvent will evaporate, so reline your cap.
 
### Column – NEW updates

Precolumn heater is installed and lines are changed.
 
### DAD

New default is not connected to DAD, you need to run viper fitting straight from column.

To use, connect, and when you are done, reset.
Attach column to DAD, attach DAD to API source. Be careful or you will inject nothing.
 
### MS

Make sure the correct line attach

Check probe position, usually “C”

Check sweep core, clean if it’s dirty. It is supposed to be cleaned as much as needed, or at approximately every two weeks.

API source can be hot to touch, so be careful when you have to remove it. It is a $30K instrument-part.
 
### Files

Data collected will be first stored in D: drive. In order for every user to be able to keep storing data, move your data to Z: drive under DATA folder.

Remember to permanently delete your data in D: drive after all have been removed to Z: drive.
