# Warnings & Trouble Shooting Errors

**Write errors/issues in the logbook file on desktop we are no longer recording in the green book. We can track issues and resolve them faster if they occur again if we have a record.**

1. **Q Exactive warnings/errors**: We have a service contract therefore we do not troubleshoot or repair the mass spectrometer. If there is an electronics issue you can try resetting the electronics first with the black reset button then wait 90 minutes. If the issue is not resolved you can switch the green switch off and on then wait 90 minutes which resets all electronics boards. 

2. **UPLC warnings/errors**:
***ALWAYS*** read the manual before asking others so that you can understand the issue and try to figure out the issue yourself!
    * This is an important part of everyone's scientific career to realize there is manuals to learn from even if it may seem "easier" to ask someone you will learn more figuring it out yourself. 
    * Of course if you are stuck it is also important to know when to ask for help or advice and if you are not familiar enough with the instrument you may need help before taking it apart so you don't make it worse. 
    * There are specific manuals for each portion of the UPLC stack on the left side of the computer. You can read in general about each part of the system to gain insight and try looking for your error and sometimes there are troubleshooting suggestions.

## General UPLC Tips:

1. Do what the error tells you to do.
2. Always read the manual!!! 
3. Look at the logbook to see if anyone else has encountered this error 
4. If you can't find helpful information from the manual. Google it! Or look at LC or MS blogs. Search the instrument type and error. Once and awhile I find something useful.
5. If you don't find anything with the above and parts needs to be replaced. In that case, someone more experienced can help you proceed.
6. Sometimes I go up to 3rd floor and ask if they have seen the error on their dionex LCs because they have the same as ours downstairs. 

## Sequence not running/not collecting data, try this:
* Check HLC status in Chromelion. Especially UV, make sure is green.
* Re-make Tune File
* Reset Computer
* Reset electronics, first black reset button then switch.
* Make sure all cords from QE connected
