# Q Exactive Normal Pressures

Vacuum gauge pressures and make sure the vacuum system is operational. 

Typical values are:
* Convection pressure: 0.8-1.5 Torr
* Last ion gauge pressure (Penning gauge): < 6X 10E -10 Torr
* Pirani gauge pressure ~ 1 Torr
* The Fore vacuum pressure should be about 1.5 mbar. 
* The UHV pressure should be around 1 .10- 10 mbar. 
* Under normal operating conditions, the high vacuum is not listed as the gauge is turned off.

Ensure that the Nitrogen gas pressure is within the operational limits: 
* 800 +/-30 kPa (8 +/- 0.3 bar, 116 +/- 4 psi) ~80-120 psi
