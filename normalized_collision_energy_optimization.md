# Normalized collision energy (NCE) optimization

**FLAG: There are many notes not transcribed from the physical SOP.**

1. Follow the tuning SOP.
    
2. To perform MS/MS, Fragmentation (scan parameters) option has to be enabled. Select NCE mode and set a collision energy in the corresponding box. A good starting value is 25 or 35 eV. Increase or decrease accordingly.

3. Use the scan plot to watch the NCE trace.
    
4. Change the NCE value to find the optimal number to put in your instrument method. 
    
5. It is possible to determine automatically which is the best HCD collision energy for one specific fragment ion. This can be achieved by performing an automatic tune.
