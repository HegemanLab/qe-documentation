# Google Calendar Equipment in the Lab

Please see below for instructions to add resource (equipment) calendars to your calendar.   

1. Navigate to [http://google.umn.edu/](http://google.umn.edu/). You may need to log in at this point.

2. Click on `Calendar` link at the top-left corner of the screen. Your Google Calendar should load.

3. On the left half way down where it says `My Calendar` just right of that click on arrow and in the drop-down menu select `Settings.` 

4. About halfway down the page on right, click the `Browse interesting calendars` link.

5. On the `Interesting Calendars` page, click the `More` tab at the top, and click the `Resources for umn.edu` link on this page.

6. Now click the `(EQ) CFANS` link on the list of UMN resource calendars. This will load the list of all CFANS resources.
Scroll down the list until you see the lab resources:
    * (EQ) CFANS-HORT GC_MS
    * (EQ) CFANS-HORT LC_MS
    * (EQ) CFANS-HORT Orbitrap (Q Exactive) 
    * (EQ) CFANS-HORT Prep LC

7. For each of these, click the `Subscribe` link that appears to the right of each entry.  The link should now say `Unsubscribe`. 

8. Now back at the main page of your calendar, you should see all the calendars listed under `Other calendars` on the left side of the page. 

## Scheduling the Resource:

1) Create an event by clicking the `Create event` button near the top left corner of the screen.

2) For the event name, include your name and the instrument 

3) Under `Privacy` at the bottom of the event creation page, make sure to click `Public.` This is VERY IMPORTANT – if you don’t click public, other lab members won’t know who reserved the machine.

4) Half way down page on right.  Add the instrument to your event. Click the `Rooms, etc.` link on the `Add:` box on the right side of the page. Type `hort` in the search box.  You’ll see the instruments listed in the results. Click the desired resource.

5) Notice that the resource now appears in the `Where` box of the event creation page.

6) Click `Save` at the top of the page and you should see the event scheduled on your calendar.  Notice that the color of the event corresponds with the resource calendar’s color (on my calendar they both appear as light blue.)
