# Extreme Low Mass Calibration

For low mass range use standard calmix but *may* need to adjust source parameters to see ions.

1. For positive typical source parameters:
   * Sheath gas: 8
   * Aux gas: 0
   * Sweep: 0
   * Spray voltage: 3.5
   * Cap temp: 320
   * S-lens: 50-60
2. Run regular calibration
   * Change scan range to include lower masses
3. List additional masses in customized calibration table \(positive\)
   * 74.096426
   * 110.07127
   * 138.06619
   * 195.08766
   * Always select all three if you select only one, tune will error
4. List additional masses in customized calibration table \(negative\)
   * 68.99576\* -with changing heater
   * 265.14790
   * \*May need to increase heater temperature to get in source fragmentation
